* This program was written with Mailgun csv suppressions in mind
* However, it just checks for a string given by the user in the given CSV file_name
* Then it prints out the rows the string was found in, into a new CSV file
* This is good for searching very large CSV files efficiently without needing to open them
* And avoids the truncating CSV problem :)
